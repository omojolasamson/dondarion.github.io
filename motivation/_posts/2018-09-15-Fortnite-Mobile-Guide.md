We want to assure you that it is completely identical to the one you are used to, and you're not going to miss a thing while playing this game on your device. The basic storyline remains the same. You get to battle 99 other players for a chance to dominate the map. The same weekly updates that are received on other platforms can also be received on your mobile device. You also have the option of playing with your friends even if they're playing on other platforms. Now that we have you convinced on why you should play the fortnite battle royale on your mobile device, let's go ahead and help you get it installed. 
The fortnight game has been available on iOS platform for a couple of months now. However, its android release is still a work in progress, as it has only been made available for samsung devices so far. It is expected to be available for other android devices as from 23rd of September.
 Xda-developers.com has hinted that the game might not be uploaded on play store which is the standard platform for android applications. It can however be downloaded directly from the fortnight website; www.fortnite.com. Once you log on to the site, click on the sign up button and supply the required details. After signing up, Epic will add you to the list of applicants that will be given access to the game, although you might have to wait a while. After you've been given access, you can download and install the game.
Below are some important features to help enhance your gaming experience:
Adapting to the new control scheme
Obviously the control scheme on your mobile phone will be much smaller than the one you're used to, but it doesn't take long to adapt to the changes. The mobile phone's control scheme is highly intuitive. The most frequently used buttons, like the looting and shooting buttons, are on the main interface and are easily accessible. But when it comes to other things like building structures, you're going to have to put in a bit more work. There's a build button on the main interface which when pressed, displays the necessary tools for creating structures.
You can practice switching between both interfaces with the pre-game lobby. Also try out different camera angles to find out the perfect position for your character.
Head up display customisation
 In the lobby, settings option can be located at the top right of the screen. After clicking on the settings option, click on "HUD layout tool". On the screen that appears, you'll be able to rearrange and redesign your control buttons to suit your preference.
Voice chat activation
The xbox mobile app allows you to chat with your friends while playing the game on your mobile phone. 
Before downloading the app, you have to create a microsoft account. Once the app has been downloaded, open it up. At the top of the screen, locate the icon with the image of three people on it, and click on the icon. You will be provided with the option of selecting the friends you want to chat with and inviting them. After selecting, you'll be able to chat with them while playing your favourite game!
Getting started
Here are a few tips and tricks to guide you on your way to becoming a pro:
Block out sound
You should seriously consider investing in some headphones, if you hope to become a pro in the game. They will help you block out distracting sounds so that you can pay maximum focus to the game. With them, you can easily hear footsteps, tinkling chests etc., giving you a complete experience of this amazing game.
Make use of the auto-run feature
Fortnite is a game that involves a lot of running around and the more ground you cover, the more prone to attack you are. Also, the control buttons are on the screen and they take up significant space, limiting the area in your view. To make up for this problem, Epic threw in a new feature that is not available in the PC and console versions; the auto-run feature. Here's how to use it:
On the left hand side of your screen, there is a control stick. When the stick is double tapped, your character runs in the direction that they are currently facing. This helps you to survey the area properly, and unveil any enemies around. Since your character runs automatically, you have no need for the control buttons and essentially free up that part of the screen, giving yourself a wider and better view.
Make use of the aim down sights feature
When playing the fortnite battle royale game on phone, aiming is a bit more difficult, as compared to playing on other platforms. However, the mobile platform has its own ADS feature.
This feature comes in handy when you are far away from your enemies. At long range distances, if you fire a shot at your enemy using normal sight, you are likely to miss. The ADS button is a crosshair located next to the crouch button. When clicked, the camera zooms in and gives you a more accurate shot. 
NB: your accuracy is increased if you crouch while shooting.
Use the tap to search/interact feature
Epic makes looting a lot easier on phone by making your character automatically take into inventory, everything he comes across.
Automatically picking up loot as you go is all nice and good, but the disadvantage of this feature is that it gets your inventory clogged up fast with stuff that you have no need for. To stop the auto pick up function, go to the settings menu and click on "tap to search/interact". This way, you can pick up really valuable items and increase your chances of winning.
