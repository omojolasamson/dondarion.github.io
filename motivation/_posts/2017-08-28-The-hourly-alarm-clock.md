The major reason why we struggle with making ourselves do what we have to do is that we leave the decision to the exact moment that we need to make it, thereby requiring a huge amount of will power from ourselves, of which most times, we do not have. If we take a look at some of the things we do with ease, we find that we have been doing them for a very long time without complaining. On the other hand, the things we have problems doing are things that we haven't done before, or do regularly, but always compain about. Either way our brains have never been given the chance to positively align with these activities or see them as fun. Our brains react to the present based on our memories and dominant thoughts. The brain has a need to relate what is happening right now to what has happened before( what is stored "upstairs"). This is why two people who witnessed the exact same event will give usually different accounts of it. It's not that they witnessed different events, it's that their brains reacted to it based on their different memories and related it with what they already had "upstairs". So when they gave accounts of the events, their accounts weren't just of the events, it was mixed with their past experiences(and opinions), most times unknown to the narrators themselves. We react to the present based on our memories and dominant thoughts, which is why whenever it's time for us to do something, the first thing our brain does is to search our memory for everything it knows about that task. Do we hate it? Are we always complaining about it? What actions do we take when it's time to carry out that task? Do we procrastinate? The brain has a need for patterns and consistency, so it tries to make you react the same way you have always reacted to that task(using patterns from your past). A student who's memory is filled with hating his/her studies and procrastinating on it will always react the same way whenever it's time to study, because the brain draws from patterns from his past( so you don't like to study because you don't like to study). During the semester, his brain compares the 'boringness' of studying(the first pattern here is seeing studying as boring) to a hundred different ways he could be having fun at that moment and if it's something of a pattern for him to go for 'fun', he will continue to do so. When it's test and exams period, this time his brain compares the 'boringness' of studying to an even deadlier consequence of failing, then the student picks the less hurtful task of studying. Unless of course there's already a pattern in his brain, of not seeing failure as something hurtful, then he still refuses to study. The only thing that differentiates such a student from someone who loves to study, is memory and dominant thoughts.
So if patterns are our doom, then they are also our saviour. If you hate to carry out some activities because of the kind of memory you have about them, then why not create new ones to "replace" the current ones? Long term memories are formed by repetition. The goal is to drill the idea into your head. Which is why Napoleon Hill Suggested that we recite our goals everyday to ourselves. But the only thing more effective than reciting something everyday is reciting it every hour. Bear in mind that this isn't the easiest thing to do. Reciting some damned thing every hour is really difficult. At this point I have to say that this method is for after you have tried everything else and just can't get yourself to do what you need to do.
Give it time: do not expect to recite twice and turn into a workaholic robot
Do not recite, produce

this method is based on choice theory that we can only control actions and thinking directly but can't control our feelings directly. And being humans, most of what we do and choose to do, is based on our feelings. Luckily for us we can control our feelings indirectly through our actions and thinking. And most articles on motivation and self discipline I have read seem to focus on control our thinking through our actions much more than through our thinking. Which is why they tell you to just take the first step into doing that activity that you hate, because once you get into it, your actions start to change your feelings about it. You start to love it. But here's the problem: When you really hate or dislike something, truth is you don't even want to take half the first step. Which is why I think the combination of both methods is the best. Using the hourly alarm clock method means configuring your thinking to change your feelings BEFORE you start the activity(your mind is prepared, and in the right form before starting) rather than trying to make yourself take the first step, even when you don't feel like it, which ironically takes almost as much willpower as making yourself do the whole activity.
