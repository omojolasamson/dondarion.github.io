The major reason why we struggle with making ourselves do what we have to do is that we leave the decision to the exact moment that we need to make it, thereby requiring a huge amount of will power from ourselves, of which most times, we do not have. If we take a look at some of the things we do with ease, we find that we have been doing them for a very long time without complaining. On the other hand, the things we have problems doing are things that we haven't done before, or do regularly, but always compain about. Either way our brains have never been given the chance to positively align with these activities or see them as fun. Our brains react to the present based on our memories and dominant thoughts. It has a need to relate what is happening right now to what has happened before( what is stored upstairs). This is why two people who witnessed the exact same event will give usually different accounts of it. It's not that they witnessed different events, it's that their brains reacted to it based on their different memories and related it with what they already had "upstairs". So when they gave accounts of the events, their accounts weren't just of the events, it was mixed with their past experiences(and opinions), most times unknown to the narrators themselves. We react to the present based on our memories and dominant thoughts, which is why whenever it's time for us to do something, the first thing our brain does is to search our memory for everything it knows about that task. Do we hate it? Are we always complaining about it? What actions do we take when it's time to carry out that task? Do we procrastinate? The brain has a need for patterns and consistency, so it tries to make you react the same way you have always reacted to that task(using patterns from your past). A student who's memory is filled with hating his/her studies and procrastinating on it will always react the same way whenever it's time to study, because the brain draws from patterns from his past( so you don't like to study because you don't like to study). During the semester, his brain compares the 'boringness' of studying(the first pattern here is seeing studying as boring) to a hundred different ways he could be having fun at that moment and if it's something of a pattern for him to go for 'fun', he will continue to do so. When it's test and exams period, this time his brain compares the 'boringness' of studying to an even deadlier consequence of failing, then the student picks the less hurtful task of studying. Unless of course there's already a pattern in his brain of not seeing failure as something hurtful, then he still refuses to study. The only thing that differentiates such a student from someone who loves to study, is memory and dominant thoughts.
So if patterns are our doom, then they are also our saviour. If you hate to carry out some activities because of the kind of memory you have about them, then why not create new ones to "replace" the current ones? Memories are formed by

the only thing more effective than reciting something everyday is reciting it every hour.
