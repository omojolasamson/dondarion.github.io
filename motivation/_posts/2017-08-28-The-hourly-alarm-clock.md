The major reason why we struggle with making ourselves do what we have to do is that we leave the decision to the exact moment that we need to make it, thereby requiring a huge amount of will power from ourselves, of which most times, we do not have. If we take a look at some of the things we do with ease, we find that we have been doing them for a very long time without complaining. On the other hand, the things we have problems doing are things that we haven't done before, or do regularly, but always compain about. Either way our brains have never been given the chance to positively align with these activities or see them as fun. Our brain reacts to the present based on our memories and dominant thoughts. It has a need to relate what is happening right now to what has happened before( what is stored upstairs). This is why two people who witnessed the exact same event will give usually different accounts of it. It's not that they witnessed different events, it's that their brains reacted to it based on their different memories and related it with what they already had upstairs. So when they gave accounts of the events, their accounts weren't just of the events, it was mixed with their past experiences(and opinions), most times unknown to the accounters themselves.

the only thing more effective than reciting something everyday is reciting it every hour.
