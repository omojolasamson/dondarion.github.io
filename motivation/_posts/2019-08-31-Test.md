title: 7 Things No Solar Company Will Tell You About Creating Free Energy For You And Your Family
---





With the continual rise in electricity costs, more and more people are considering getting solar energy systems for their homes. Since solar energy is a relatively novel technology, especially in mainstream life, the trick for consumers becomes understanding that you don’t know what you don’t know. 

A lot of solar companies use this lack of information to their advantage. They sell whatever they want, however they want to unsuspecting customers. What is the one thing that we have that makes other solar companies hate us? TRANSPARENCY.

We are going to show you the way to do it with zero cost. You want to be ahead of the game, and we will help you get there.

Because SocialSite believes in educating consumers about solar energy, we’ve compiled this list of important information that many folks in the solar industry would prefer to keep under wraps. Armed with this information, you’ll be able to make an informed decision on whether or not solar energy is right for you.




1. You may not be a good candidate for solar energy.
Believe it or not, not every home is initially a good candidate for solar energy. Some solar company salesmen will happily install a solar system in your home and you’ll be paying for that mistake for years to come. Along with living in a state with very low electricity costs, there are other things to consider regarding solar energy. 

For instance, you might need to cut down trees that surround and beautify your home, and that can be very expensive. You may not even have the right roof to support solar panels structurally. These aren’t topics that solar panel companies are going to put right out there in front of you, but you should think of all of these things as you consider your options.















2. Examine whether buying or leasing solar panels is right for you.
Solar leasing has become a popular option for consumers over the last couple of years with tens of thousands of homeowners responding to ‘$0 down solar’ and ‘free installation’ offers. What’s not to like? It’s free and it saves you money, but have you ever wondered what it is solar companies aren’t telling you?

People who buy their solar panels instead of leasing them enjoy far more benefits (and avoid some headaches later on). Only people purchasing solar panels qualify for the many government financial aid programs and incentives. Owning solar panels also increases your home’s market value, while leasing them can be potentially burdensome when it comes time to sell your home. Make sure to do your homework well, and choose the option that best suits your finances.

Solar panel manufacturers try to get people to lease solar panels, insisting that you won’t have to worry about maintenance. Don’t let this get to you! The only thing you have to do is keep the panels clear of debris, by using a garden hose, a few times a year.








3. SREC’s and tax credits can go away at any time.

Solar panel manufacturers will push you to invest in their product for a lot of reasons, including the promise of SRECs (Solar Renewable Energy Credit) and tax credits.
For every Megawatt-hour of electricity produced by your solar panels, an SREC, which stands for Solar Renewable Energy Credit, is earned. 

In certain states, these Solar Renewable Energy Credits are sold to utility companies who will pay homeowners for each SREC that they purchase. Additionally, homeowners are currently eligible for state and federal solar incentives that can help offset your cost.

While these programs and credits are great for homeowners with solar panels, they’re susceptible to change. For example, the Federal Solar Tax Credit will end for home solar come 2021, and tax credits in four other states will expire this year. If you’re thinking about solar, don’t hesitate to schedule a free solar consultation with us. You don’t want to miss out on Solar Renewable Energy Credits or tax credits before it’s too late.






4. Your panels’ effectiveness drops each year.
Although the drop is of little magnitude, manufacturers but solar panel manufacturers aren’t going to be quick to disclose that they expect that a solar panel lowers its efficiency by about 1% per year. This means that at the end of 20 years, it could be running at 80% efficiency of what it used to. There really is not that much research done on this subject because the majority of solar panels around the globe are only about 10 years old.

Some companies use panels that are of low quality, and they end up dying within 5-7 years. SocialSite circumvents this problem by using panels that are of top-notch quality. You’ll pay a little more, but you’ll be able to pay it off sooner and attain full ownership quicker.















5. Solar systems aren’t one-size-fits-all.
Your solar system should be customized to match home energy needs. The number of solar panels you need depends on the performance of each panel, how many peak hours of sunlight your panels can expect to receive and the size of your roof. A solar company might want to sell you a system that’s either too big or too small (as a lease). 

At SocialSite, we prioritize efficiency above every other thing. We sell you a system that fits your house perfectly - not too small, not too big. We also help you switch your bulbs to led, install smart thermostats, and other appliances that constitute a home efficiency kit.
















6. You need to watch out for the warranty.
Just as solar panel installers aren’t created equally, so are some warranties better than others. Most manufacturers have a warranty period of 20-25 years, which is long enough to have your investment pay off and make a profit. However, for the warranty to be honoured, the company still needs to be operating.

It’s important you do your research on the solar panel manufacturers out there, and hone in on which one has the best warranty. As always, choose a manufacturer that has a solid reputation.

Some solar companies present you with really compelling numbers, and you think they are making money. In reality, the opposite is the case. Most of them are going bankrupt or millions in debt, in spite of millions of dollars in investment from Wall Street investors. This is because of the huge cost of customer acquisition. 

So basically, they are looking for a way to make you pay their debt. They rent a home depot, rent a space and employ people to chase potential customers with brochures. They employ managers, cold call salesmen and multi-level marketers, just to get a little piece of the action. All these expenses run up costs and make a lot of these companies desperate. You should do your research well and look for companies with good reputation.



7. You’ll still lose your power during an outage.
We’re sure you’ve been thinking to yourself “If I create my own electricity, I’ll still have electricity during a power outage.” Unfortunately, that’s not the case unless you have a battery back-up system installed. Most homes that use solar aren’t entirely self-sufficient and must still be hooked up to the grid. That’s because your system might produce more energy than your home needs and the excess power has to go somewhere. 

Your solar system shuts off during an outage so as to protect utility workers from injury. There however, is an advantage to being connected to the grid. The initial investment for a solar panel system can be gotten back quickly by selling your surplus energy to a utility company.

The government requires 42 states and the District of Columbia to purchase surplus power from their consumers. The way to take advantage of this process, and the subsequent rate you will receive for your surplus energy, varies from state to state.

There are a few standard methods of reimbursement for surplus power. They are known as net-metering. If you generate more power than you use in a given month, you will see a credit applied to your bill. At the end of a year, if you have a surplus of energy, you will be paid in cash, at a wholesale rate, per kilowatt hour.

The only way to keep your electricity when the grid goes down is by purchasing a battery. Having a battery when the grid goes down gives you energy independence, because you’ll have electricity off grid. Batteries are quite expensive, and are already pretty much as cheap as they are ever going to be. 

Some solar companies will want to sell you batteries you don’t need, claiming you should have one for times of emergency. You buy it and then you have a battery sitting out the back, working only two nights a year.

SocialSite on the other hand, ranks customer happiness above everything else. When you go into business with us, we go into a 20 year relationship together. We are in it for the long haul. If you live in an area where the power only goes down for 2 nights in a year, then we advise you against getting a battery. 

If you live in an area where the power sometimes goes down for a week, then it will make more economical sense to get a battery. So really, getting a battery depends more on where you are than anything else.
